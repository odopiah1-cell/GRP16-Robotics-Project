# GRP16-Robotics-Project
Group 16 was given a robot chassis which includes motors, sensors and batteries. Our main objective is to program a microcontroller to control the robot.

Robot Activity
At switch on, all four LEDs will flash on and off for a duration of 3 seconds. At the end of this
initialisation the robot scans the room to detect an emergency beacon, and once detected
the robot proceeds towards the beacon whilst avoiding any obstacles on the way.
Below is a list of the planned activities:
  • Activity 1, Week 7: Flash the LEDs (Familiarisation lab)
  • Activity 2&3, Week 9: Move the robot (3 marks)/Avoid obstacles (3 marks)
  • Activity 3&4, Week 12: Avoid obstacles (3 marks)/Detect the emergency beacon (3 marks)
  • Activity 5, January exam period: Put it all together to achieve the 
    specification given above + some advanced objectives (16 marks)
